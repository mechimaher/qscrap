## 3️⃣ Architecture Snapshots

### Folder Structure (Both Apps)

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI elements
├── config/         # API URLs, endpoints
├── constants/      # Theme, status mappings, data
├── contexts/       # React Context providers
├── hooks/          # Custom hooks (socket, badges)
├── i18n/           # en.ts, ar.ts translations
├── screens/        # Feature screens
├── services/       # API, socket, notifications
├── stores/         # [Driver only] Zustand stores
└── utils/          # Helper functions
```

### Shared vs Isolated Logic

| Logic Type | Rule |
|------------|------|
| Theme tokens | Shared concept, separate files per app |
| API client | Separate implementations; different auth keys |
| Socket events | App-specific handlers; common server |
| i18n translations | Separate bundles; Customer = 150KB, Driver = 15KB |

### Data Flow Model

```
User Action
    ↓
Screen Component
    ↓
Context/Hook (state management)
    ↓
ApiService.request() → 15s timeout → Backend
    ↓
Response → State Update → UI Render
```

### API Interaction Pattern

- **Base URL:** `https://api.qscrap.qa/api`
- **Auth:** Bearer token in `Authorization` header
- **Timeout:** 15 seconds (30s for uploads)
- **Token Storage:** `expo-secure-store`

### Realtime Topology

```
Socket Server (api.qscrap.qa)
    ├── Customer App
    │   └── Events: new_bid, order_status_updated, driver_location_update
    └── Driver App
        └── Events: new_assignment, assignment_updated, assignment_cancelled
```

## 4️⃣ Code Intelligence Memory

### ApiService (Both Apps)

| Aspect | Memory |
|--------|--------|
| **Responsibility** | All HTTP communication with backend |
| **Why It Exists** | Centralize auth, timeout, error handling |
| **Must Never Do** | Store tokens in plain AsyncStorage; skip timeout |
| **Coupling** | Tightly coupled to SecureStore; loosely to screens |
| **Tradeoffs** | 908 lines (Customer) is large but justified by method count |

### useSocket Hook (Customer)

| Aspect | Memory |
|--------|--------|
| **Responsibility** | Manage socket lifecycle, emit/receive events, trigger notifications |
| **Why It Exists** | Encapsulate reconnection logic and ghost filtering |
| **Must Never Do** | Process bids older than 5 minutes (ghost prevention) |
| **Coupling** | Depends on AuthContext for user ID |
| **Tradeoffs** | 606 lines is comprehensive; handles 15+ event types |

### OfflineQueue (Driver)

| Aspect | Memory |
|--------|--------|
| **Responsibility** | Queue API calls when offline; flush when online |
| **Why It Exists** | Drivers operate in low-connectivity zones |
| **Must Never Do** | Retry client errors (4xx); they will never succeed |
| **Coupling** | Uses MMKV for persistence; NetInfo for connectivity |
| **Tradeoffs** | 50 retry limit prevents infinite loops |

### useJobStore (Driver)

| Aspect | Memory |
|--------|--------|
| **Responsibility** | Hold assignment list and active assignment |
| **Why It Exists** | Persist state across app restarts |
| **Must Never Do** | Merge with offline queue; backend is source of truth |
| **Coupling** | Zustand + MMKV middleware |
| **Tradeoffs** | Chose backend-first sync to prevent "stacked" states |

## 5️⃣ API & Backend Contracts Memory

### Customer App APIs

| Endpoint Category | Count | Critical Notes |
|-------------------|-------|----------------|
| Auth | 4 | `userType` must be `customer` |
| Requests | 8 | 30s timeout for FormData uploads |
| Orders | 6 | Status transitions enforced server-side |
| Payments | 4 | Stripe intents with `loyaltyDiscount` param |
| Profile | 5 | Account deletion is soft delete |

### Driver App APIs

| Endpoint Category | Count | Critical Notes |
|-------------------|-------|----------------|
| Auth | 2 | `userType` must be `driver` |
| Assignments | 6 | Status transitions: assigned→picked_up→in_transit→delivered |
| Wallet | 3 | Payout created on POD completion |
| Location | 1 | Reports driver GPS to backend |

### Auth Model Assumptions

- JWT tokens, no refresh flow (re-authenticate on expiry)
- SecureStore timeout wrapper (5s) prevents hangs
- In-memory cache used if SecureStore is slow

### Error Handling Contract

```typescript
// Standard error shape from backend
{ error: string, message?: string }

// Client-side handling
throw new Error(data.error || data.message || 'Request failed');
```

### Versioning Expectations

- No explicit API versioning in URLs
- Breaking changes require app store update

---

## 6️⃣ Realtime & Notifications Memory

### Socket.IO Usage Model

| App | Connection Trigger | Disconnect Trigger |
|-----|-------------------|-------------------|
| Customer | `isAuthenticated` becomes true | Logout or app kill |
| Driver | `isAuthenticated && driver` exists | Logout or app kill |

### Event Ownership

| Event | Owner App | Server Emitter |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| `new_bid` | Customer | When garage submits bid |
| `order_status_updated` | Customer | On any status change |
| `driver_location_update` | Customer | Every 10s during delivery |
| `new_assignment` | Driver | When admin assigns order |
| `assignment_cancelled` | Driver | When order is cancelled |

### Push vs Realtime Responsibilities

| Scenario | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| App in foreground | Socket.IO → Local notification |
| App in background | Push notification (Expo) |
| App killed | Push notification only |

### Known Edge Cases

- **Ghost bids:** Bids older than 5 minutes are filtered (stale WebSocket data)
- **Reconnection:** Max attempts before showing manual reconnect UI

### Do's & Don'ts

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|-------|---------|
| Deduplicate by `bid_id`/`order_id` | Ever trust client timestamps for ordering |
| Show haptic feedback on new data | Queue events while authenticated=false |
| Auto-reconnect on app foreground | Keep socket connected when logged out |

## 7️⃣ Risks, Debt & Misalignments Registry

| ID | Description | Severity | Area | Root Cause | Resolution |
|----|-------------|----------|------|------------|------------|
| R1 | Duplicate socket implementations | Low | Customer | Legacy code not removed | Deprecate `socket.ts` |
| R2 | No screen-level error boundaries | Low | Driver | Initial MVP scope | Add boundaries to critical screens |
| R3 | Separate type definitions | Low | Both | No shared package | Future monorepo consideration |

**Zero Critical or High severity issues identified.**

## 8️⃣ Enhancement Ledger

### E1: ~~Consolidate Socket Services~~ ✅ RESOLVED (Feb 4, 2026)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Previous State** | `socket.ts` (119 lines) + `useSocket.tsx` (606 lines) coexisted |
| **Resolution** | Deleted `socket.ts`; `useSocket.tsx` is now sole socket manager |
| **Impact** | Reduced cognitive load; single source of truth |

### E2: ~~Screen-Level Error Boundaries~~ ✅ RESOLVED (Feb 4, 2026)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Previous State** | Root-only ErrorBoundary |
| **Resolution** | Created `ScreenErrorBoundary.tsx` + `withErrorBoundary.tsx` HOC |
| **Wrapped Screens** | RequestDetailScreen, OrderDetailScreen, DeliveryTrackingScreen |
| **Benefit** | Screen-level errors gracefully degrade with retry button |

### E3: Shared Types Package

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Current State** | Duplicate types in both apps |
| **Target State** | Shared `@qscrap/types` package |
| **Reasoning** | Type consistency; single update point |
| **Simplicity Justification** | Only worth it if monorepo exists |
| **Customer Impact** | None (developer experience) |

## 9️⃣ Architectural Decisions Record (ADR-lite)

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 15s network timeout | Prevents indefinite hangs; user feedback within reasonable time |
| SecureStore for tokens | Encrypted storage; Expo standard |
| Backend as source of truth | Prevents "stacked" offline states |
| 5-minute ghost bid filter | Stale WebSocket data can arrive late |
| Signature removed from POD | Enterprise speed optimization (Operations can view photo) |
| MMKV over AsyncStorage | Synchronous access; faster boot |

### Decisions Rejected

| Rejected Approach | Why Rejected |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Redux for state | Overkill for this scale; Context + Zustand sufficient |
| GraphQL | Backend is REST; no benefit to adding layer |
| Custom push server | Expo handles reliably; no need |
| Infinite retry on offline | Would cause infinite loops on 4xx errors |

### Patterns Forbidden

| Pattern | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Plain AsyncStorage for auth tokens | Security risk |
| Hardcoded API URLs in screens | Config must be centralized |
| Direct fetch() without timeout | Can hang indefinitely |
| Storing full user object in global state | Only store what's needed |

### Patterns Encouraged

| Pattern | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| AbortController for ALL fetches | Graceful cancellation |
| Haptic feedback on user actions | Premium UX standard |
| Offline queue for driver actions | Field conditions require it |
| Qatar branding in theme constants | Institutional identity |
