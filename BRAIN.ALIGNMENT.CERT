| **4 orphaned controllers** | Dead code | ⚠️ MINOR |
| **20+ inline route handlers** | Anti-pattern | ⚠️ MINOR |
| **0% contract test coverage** | No runtime validation | ❌ FAIL |
| **Database schema not verified** | Unknown drift risk | ⚠️ BLOCKED |

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Spec Exists (100%) | ❌ FAIL | Only 2.3% (7/306) documented |
| Controller Exists (100%) | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 87.5% (28/32) aligned |
| DTO Match (100%) | ❌ FAIL | Not verified |
| DB Mapping (100%) | ❌ BLOCKED | Local DB offline |

## REMEDIATION PLAN

**Phase 1:** Remove orphaned controllers (2h)  
**Phase 2:** Extract inline handlers (8h)  
**Phase 3:** Generate OpenAPI spec (40h)  
**Phase 4:** Implement contract testing (60h)  
**Phase 5:** Verify DB schema (8h)  
**Phase 6:** Idempotency audit (4h)

**Total Effort:** 122 hours (~3 weeks with dedicated team)

## NEXT STEPS

1. Open 6 remediation PRs (see `/audit/fix-prs.csv`)
2. Prioritize PR-003 (OpenAPI spec generation) — BLOCKING
3. Re-audit after Phase 3 completion
4. Target certification date: **March 10, 2026**
