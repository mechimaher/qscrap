        <h1>Driver Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: January 31, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to QScrap Driver. By accessing or using the QScrap Driver application ("App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). These terms are drafted in compliance with the laws of the State of Qatar.</p>

        <h2>1. Relationship</h2>
        <p>You acknowledge that you are an <span class="highlight">independent contractor</span> and not an employee of QScrap. You are responsible for your own vehicle maintenance, insurance, and compliance with local traffic laws.</p>

        <h2>2. Service Standards</h2>
        <p>As a QScrap Driver, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain a professional appearance and demeanor.</li>
            <li>Transport parts safely and securely to prevent damage.</li>
            <li>Update assignment statuses (Pickup, In-Transit, Delivered) accurately and in real-time.</li>
            <li>Capture clear, legible photos for Proof of Delivery (POD) and Inspections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Delivery Fees & Refusals (Strict Policy)</h2>
        <div class="fee-policy">
            <strong>Non-Refundable Delivery Fees:</strong> The Delivery Fee covers the logistics service provided by the Driver. This fee is <strong>earned and payable upon the Driver's arrival</strong> at the delivery location.
        </div>
        <p>To ensure the sustainability of the service, the following rules apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Rendered:</strong> Once you (the Driver) arrive at the Customer's location, the transportation service is considered "Rendered".</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Refusal:</strong> If a Customer refuses to accept the item for any reason (including "change of mind" or "wrong item ordered"), they are still liable for the Delivery Fee. The business cannot absorb the cost of fuel and time for a completed trip.</li>
            <li><strong>Collection:</strong> In Cash-on-Delivery (COD) scenarios, you are instructed to request the Delivery Fee even if the item is returned. If the Customer refuses to pay, you must report this to Operations immediately for account flagging.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Returns & Disputes (Qatar Ministry of Commerce Compliance)</h2>
        <div class="important">
            <strong>Consumer Protection Law No. 8 of 2008:</strong> QScrap adheres strictly to Qatar's consumer protection laws regarding the return and exchange of defective goods.
        </div>
        <p>As a Driver, you play a critical role in this compliance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mandatory Returns:</strong> If a Customer refuses a part due to non-conformity or defect, or if a "Return" assignment is dispatched to you, you <span class="highlight">must accept and execute the return trip</span> to the Garage. Refusal to facilitate a valid return is a violation of these Terms.</li>
            <li><strong>Dispute Neutrality:</strong> You are a logistics facilitator. You must not arbitrate disputes between the Customer and Garage. If a dispute arises at the doorstep, you must contact Operations Support immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Condition Check:</strong> For returns, you must inspect the item and capture photos to verify its condition before accepting it back, ensuring it matches the "Delivered" state (unless the defect is the reason for return).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Location Services</h2>
        <p>You agree to allow QScrap to collect and use your precise location data <span class="highlight">while the App is in use and in the background</span> during active assignments. This data is used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dispatch nearby assignments to you.</li>
            <li>Provide real-time tracking to customers and garages.</li>
            <li>Calculate accurate delivery times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may disable location services when you are "Offline", but you will not be able to receive new assignments.</p>

        <h2>6. Privacy & Data</h2>
        <p>Your use of the App is also governed by our Privacy Policy. You understand that your name, photo, and vehicle details will be shared with Customers and Garages for identification purposes.</p>

        <h2>7. Liability</h2>
        <p>You are liable for any loss or damage to the parts while they are in your custody (from Pickup to Delivery). QScrap reserves the right to deduct the cost of damaged goods from your compensation if negligence is proven.</p>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>QScrap reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account for violations of these Terms, including but not limited to: repeated failed deliveries, low ratings, unsafe driving, or fraudulent activity.</p>

        <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Qatar. Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Qatar.</p>
